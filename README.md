## Description
As an aspiring data analyst and recent biochemistry graduate with a 2.1, I am currently enrolled in the Aicore program, where I am actively honing my skills in practical applications of AI and Data. My goal for this project is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the loan portfolio of a significant financial institution.

Project Overview:
In my current role, managing loans is a critical aspect of business operations. To ensure informed decisions about loan approvals and efficient risk management, I am tasked with gaining a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data through EDA. This involves using various statistical and data visualization techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the loan data.

Key Objectives:

Informative Decision-Making: My aim is to enable the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management based on the insights derived from the EDA.

Risk and Return Analysis: I will conduct a thorough analysis of the risk and return associated with the business' loans to facilitate better risk management practices.

Performance Enhancement: The ultimate goal is to improve the overall performance and profitability of the loan portfolio by identifying areas of improvement and optimization.

Project Workflow:
The project involves the following key steps, which I will personally oversee:

Data Collection: Gather loan portfolio data from the financial institution's database.
Data Exploration: Perform initial exploration of the data to understand its structure, quality, and characteristics.
Statistical Analysis: Utilize statistical techniques to analyze key metrics, identify trends, and assess risk factors.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to effectively communicate insights and patterns discovered during the analysis.
Outlier Handling: Address outliers in the data to ensure robust and accurate analysis.
Data Skewness Correction: Normalize data skewness to enhance the reliability of statistical inferences.
ML Algorithm Preparation: Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms by optimizing features and addressing data intricacies.
Payment Forecasting: Visualize future payments to provide a predictive understanding of the loan portfolio's financial trajectory.
Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between user data parameters and loan payment outcomes.
Decision Support System: Develop a decision support system that empowers the business with actionable insights for loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.
Expected Impact:
By the end of this project, I anticipate delivering a robust Exploratory Data Analysis that not only uncovers valuable insights within the loan portfolio data but also serves as a foundation for improved decision-making processes. My efforts aim to contribute significantly to the business's ability to manage loans effectively, enhance performance, and optimize profitability.
